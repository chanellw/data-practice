1. Include the correct header to use strings in C++
2. Create a variable to hold a string
3. Prompt the user to enter a string
4. Print out the string using the variable and print out the size of the string variable in bytes
5. Create a variable called bank_account that will store a floating-point value
6. Prompt the user to enter a value and store it in the bank_account variable
7. Print out the value and the size of the variable in bytes
8. Multiply the bank_account variable by 2 and print its size
9. Make a comment about what you observe about the size before and after multiplication
